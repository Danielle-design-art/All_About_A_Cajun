# All About A Cajun

## I am a born and raised cajun from _"Da Berry"_

### I love gardening, crocheting, drawing and cooking. All of these are just some creative outlets I use as therapy. Some of my favorite sites include [Ravelry](https://ravelry.com) and [AllFreeCrochet](https://allfreecrochet.com)

### I am expecting my first child with someone I Thank God for everyday. Our miracle baby comes late for both of us in life as we are in our late 30s. We are looking forward to welcoming her and thereby starting a whole new chapter in our lives

### I also love traveling from time to time as I lived in the New England area for about 10 years. I worked a lot in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and even Maine while there. I eventually got so homesick I moved back. It's a beautiful country up there, but there's still no place like home
